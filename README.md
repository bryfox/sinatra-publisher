# Sinatra Publisher

## Publish an erb-based sinatra app out to static HTML files. 

Perhaps you need to get a simple site up on GoDaddy, but can't kick the Sinatra habit.

Supports routes with a single parameter by supplying a list of values for each route at startup.

See example/app.rb for usage and options.

Built against Sinatra 1.1.
